## About
This is a boilerplate project for developing client-side code using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

[<sup>Back to top</sup>](#typo-typescript-boilerplate)

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (6.x minimum required)
  - [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) is usually included with Node.js
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (recommended)
- Editor with support for TypeScript, [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/), and [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) (ex. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Getting Started
1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm **or** Yarn:
  - `npm install`
  - `yarn`
3. Start running tasks as described below in the [tasks section](#tasks).

```

### Entry Points
When JavaScript code is built, any files directly inside the `src/` directory are used to create the output files. The boilerplate currently generates `app.js`, as there is a single entry point inside `src/`. (`src/app.tsx`) If there are more than one entry points more files generated as well as an additional file `common.js`, which contains shared code across all entry points. `common.js` must be loaded before you load an entry point. You can see what gets generated by running the `build:dev`/`build:prod` task. (see the [tasks section](#tasks))

### Other Files

#### `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`
Tests for components/domains/logic/etc. Some guides on tests include:
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html)

#### `__snapshots__`
Generated files/directories when using Jest's [snapshot feature](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html#snapshot-testing). These files should be left to Jest and not touched manually.

## Tasks
Tasks can be executed in the following manner:
```
npm run [command]  # npm
yarn run [command] # Yarn
```
Examples:
```
npm run build:dev
yarn run lint
```

### `server:hot`
Start a local development server in port 3000 by default. To use another port have the environment variable `PORT` set to a number or modify `hot-server.js`. This task is also available as an alias to `server`. The following is provided in the development server:
- [Hot reloading](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html)

### `build:dev`
Build application and include assets into a packaged build in the `dist/` directory. This build is not minifed and includes source maps. Ideal for development.

### `build:prod`
Build application and include assets into a packaged build in the `dist/` directory. This build is minified (with dead code elimination) and does not include source maps. Ideal for production. This task is also available as an alias to `start`. (`npm start`, `yarn start`)

### `test`
Run tests once using Jest. For more information visit the [documentation for Jest](facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html).

### `test:watch`
Run tests once and rerun on changes using Jest.

### `lint`
Verify that code is valid using TypeScript and TSLint. For customzation modify `tsconfig.json` and/or `tslint.json`.

### `coverage`
Like `test` task, but also collects code coverage, which becomes available in the `coverage/` directory.

### `coverage:watch`
Run converage once and rerun on changes using Jest.
