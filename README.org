** About
This is a boilerplate project for developing and packaging web server(s) using [[https://www.typescriptlang.org/][TypeScript]] and [[https://hapijs.com/][Hapi]].

*** Entry Points
When TypeScript code is built, any code inside the =src/bin/= directory are used to create the output files. The boilerplate currently generates =app.js=, as there is a single entry point inside =src/bin/=. (=src/bin/index.js=) You can see what gets generated by running the =build:dev= / =build:prod= task. (see the [[#tasks][tasks section]])
*** Other Files
**** =*.test.ts=, =*.test.tsx=
Tests for components/domains/logic/etc. If code needs to be run before tests are executed see =setup-tests.ts= Some guides on tests include:
- [[https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html][Jest]]
**** =__snapshots__=
Generated files/directories when using Jest's [[https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html#snapshot-testing][snapshot feature]]. These files should be left to Jest and not touched manually.

** Tasks
Tasks can be executed in the following manner:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
npm run [command]  # npm
#+END_EXAMPLE
Examples:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
npm run server
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** =package=
Package application using [[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/pack][npm pack]] so that it can be installed and run standalone. Take advantage of [[https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv][dotenv]] and use =.env= for configuration.
**** Note
Make sure that [[https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package][.npmignore]] is up to date when using this task.
*** =server=
Alias for =server:dev=.
*** =server:dev= / =server:prod=
Start server in a development or production environment. To override the port change the environment variable =PORT=.
*** =build:dev= / =build:prod=
Build executables in the =dist/bin/= directory. The build for =build:dev= is not minifed and includes source maps, making it ideal for development. The build for =build:prod= is minified (with dead code elimination) and does not include source maps, making it ideal for production.
*** =test= / =test:watch= / =coverage= / =coverage:watch=
Execute tests once or continuously on file changes. In addition, code coverage can be determined.
*** =lint= / =lint:fix=
Check codebase against linting rules. Optionally, some errors can be fixed automatically.
*** =clean=
Cleans up JS code that was generated from building with =package=.
