** About
This is a boilerplate project for developing [[https://electron.atom.io/][Electron]] applications using [[https://www.typescriptlang.org/][TypeScript]] and [[https://webpack.js.org/][Webpack]].

^{[[#typo-typescript-boilerplate][Back to top]]}

** Prerequisites
- [[https://nodejs.org/en/][Node.js]] (8.x minimum required)
  - [[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm][npm CLI]] is usually included with Node.js
- Editor with support for TypeScript, [[https://palantir.github.io/tslint/][TSLint]], and [[http://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] (ex. [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][Visual Studio Code]])

** Getting Started
1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm:
   - =npm install=
3. Start running tasks as described below in the [[#tasks][tasks section]].

*** Entry Points
When TypeScript code is built, any code inside the =src/bin/= directory and any files directly inside the =assets/= directory are used to create the output files. Files in =src/bin= are built for Electron main process, while files in =src/assets= are built for Electron renderer process. You can see what gets generated by running the =build:dev= / =build:prod= task. (see the [[#tasks][tasks section]])
*** Other Files
**** =*.test.ts=, =*.test.tsx=
Tests for components/domains/logic/etc. If code needs to be run before tests are executed see =setup-tests.ts= Some guides on tests include:
- [[https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html][Jest]]
**** =__snapshots__=
Generated files/directories when using Jest's [[https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html#snapshot-testing][snapshot feature]]. These files should be left to Jest and not touched manually.

** Tasks
Tasks can be executed in the following manner:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
npm run [command]  # npm
#+END_EXAMPLE
Examples:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
npm run server
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** =package=
Package application using [[https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder][electron-builder]].
*** =server=
Alias for =server:hot=.
*** =server:dev= / =server:prod= / =server:hot=
Start server in a development or production environment and launch Electron development application. To override the port change the environment variable =PORT=.The following is also provided with server:hot:
- [[https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement][Hot reloading]]
*** =build:dev= / =build:prod=
Build application and include assets into a packaged build in the =dist/= directory. The build for =build:dev= is not minifed and includes source maps, making it ideal for development. The build for =build:prod= is minified (with dead code elimination) and does not include source maps, making it ideal for production.
*** =test= / =test:watch= / =coverage= / =coverage:watch=
Execute tests once or continuously on file changes. In addition, code coverage can be determined. For more information visit the [[https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html][documentation for Jest]].
*** =lint= / =lint:fix=
Check codebase against linting rules. Optionally, some errors can be fixed automatically.
